# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number *16* into its *binary representation* using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the value 16 to a variable a.
2. Use the built-in bin() function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
Add Code Here

a = 16
print(bin(a))
